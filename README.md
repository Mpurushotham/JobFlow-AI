## ⚙️ Deployment & Configuration

JobFlow AI is designed to be deployed on modern hosting platforms like Vercel. It requires a single environment variable to be configured for the Gemini API to function.

**Setting up your API Key:**

1.  Go to your project settings on your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel).
2.  Navigate to the "Environment Variables" section.
3.  Create a new environment variable with the following name and value:
    -   **Name:** `API_KEY`
    -   **Value:** `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` (Replace this with your actual Google Gemini API key).

The application will read this key at runtime. If the key is not found, the app will display a configuration error on startup.

**Note:** For local development, you may need to use a tool that loads environment variables (like `dotenv`).

## 🛠️ How It Works

JobFlow AI is a completely serverless, client-side application built with:

- **React & TypeScript:** For a robust and modern user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid, utility-first styling.
- **@google/genai:** The official SDK for leveraging the power of the Gemini API.
- **Web Speech API:** Powers the interactive mock interview simulator.
- **Local Storage:** Used as the database to ensure user data privacy.

## 🏁 Getting Started

1.  **Configure your API Key:** Set up the `API_KEY` environment variable as described in the section above.
2.  **Navigate to the Profile Tab:** Go to "Profile" and paste your complete master resume. Fill in your details and save.
3.  **Check Your Resume Health:** Go to the **"AI Coach"** tab and run the "Resume Health Check" for foundational feedback.
4.  **Find or Add a Job:** Use the **"Find Jobs"** tab or manually add jobs via the **"Add Job"** button.
5.  **Open the Workspace:** Click any job to open the AI Workspace and use the tools to tailor your resume and cover letter.
6.  **Practice Interviewing:** Return to the **"AI Coach"** to run a live mock interview session.
